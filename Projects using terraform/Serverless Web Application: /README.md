# Serverless Web Application Infrastructure with AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD

This Terraform script helps you set up the foundational infrastructure for a serverless web application on AWS. The infrastructure includes AWS services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Additionally, the script can be integrated with CI/CD for automated deployments.

## Components and Explanation

1. **AWS Provider Configuration**:
   - The script specifies the AWS region where the infrastructure resources will be created.

2. **DynamoDB Table for Application Data**:
   - The script creates a DynamoDB table named `app-data-table` to store data for your web application.
   - The table uses on-demand billing and has a primary key attribute named "id."

3. **Lambda Function for API Backend**:
   - An AWS Lambda function is defined with the name `api-backend`.
   - This Lambda function serves as the backend for your API.
   - You should provide your Lambda deployment package (ZIP file) and configure the function's runtime and handler.
   - It is associated with an IAM role that allows it to interact with other AWS services.

4. **IAM Role for Lambda Execution**:
   - An IAM role named `lambda-execution-role` is created to grant the Lambda function the necessary permissions for execution.

5. **API Gateway for Web Application**:
   - The script creates an AWS API Gateway with a root resource and HTTP method.
   - The Lambda function (`api-backend`) is integrated with the API Gateway.
   - The integration is set up for a POST method with an AWS_PROXY type.
   - Method response and response headers are configured, allowing for CORS support ("Access-Control-Allow-Origin").

Please note that this is a foundational example. To create a complete serverless web application, you will need to include frontend assets, implement authentication, and define additional features. Additionally, security considerations, such as proper IAM roles and permissions, should be addressed.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed.
2. Configure your AWS credentials.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Customize the script by adding your specific application logic, authentication, and frontend code.
5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
6. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.

## CI/CD and Automated Deployments

To achieve automated deployments, you need to:
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like AWS CodePipeline.
- Configure your deployment process to include frontend assets and Lambda function updates.
- Implement proper testing and validation in your CI/CD pipeline.
