# Serverless Data Pipeline with AWS, Lambda, S3, and Glue

This Terraform script helps you set up a serverless data pipeline on AWS, using services like AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and AWS Glue. A serverless data pipeline is essential for data transformation, analysis, and reporting.

## Components and Explanation

1. **S3 Buckets**:
   - The script creates two S3 buckets:
     - `raw_data_bucket`: This bucket is used to store raw data that needs to be processed.
     - `processed_data_bucket`: This bucket is for storing the processed data.

2. **Lambda Function for Data Ingestion**:
   - An AWS Lambda function named `data-ingestion-lambda` is defined.
   - This Lambda function is responsible for ingesting data from the `raw_data_bucket` to the `processed_data_bucket`.
   - You should provide your Lambda deployment package (ZIP file) and set up environment variables like the bucket names.

3. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - An IAM role for Lambda execution (`lambda-execution-role`) is created and attached with necessary policies, such as Amazon S3 access.
   - An IAM role for AWS Glue job execution (`glue-execution-role`) is also defined and attached with required policies.

4. **Event Source Mapping**:
   - An event source mapping is set up to trigger the Lambda function (`data-ingestion-lambda`) whenever new data arrives in the `raw_data_bucket`.

5. **AWS Glue Job for Data Transformation**:
   - An AWS Glue job named `data-transformation-job` is created.
   - This Glue job is responsible for data transformation and processing.
   - You should specify the location of your data transformation script in an S3 bucket.

6. **Customization Required**:
   - The script provides a basic infrastructure for a data pipeline but requires customization for specific data sources, transformation logic, and data targets.
   - You should add dependencies for the Glue job, define triggers, and set up CloudWatch alarms and monitoring for pipeline health.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed.
2. Configure your AWS credentials.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Customize the script by adding your data sources, transformation logic, and Glue job dependencies.
5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
6. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.

## Further Enhancements

To make this data pipeline fully functional, you need to:
- Define the data sources for the S3 buckets.
- Specify the transformation logic in your Glue job script.
- Set up triggers and scheduling for the Glue job.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and alarms to ensure the pipeline's health and reliability.
